# File-Manager-in-Operating-System
This C++ implementation requires Kernal based File Management techniques for handling File Descriptors, Directories and sub-directories by using functions like Fopen, Fclose,Fseek, Fread and Fmkdir.

A small Introduction to assignment:

      File Manager:
    Our File Manager require kernel level interaction for creating Files, Directories and sub-directories. A file can store some specific bytes of data and require File Descriptor for indexing of files. Use Indexed Allocation for tracking file blocks. It require implementation of following API’s:

    •	FLs()
    •	fOpen()
    •	fClose()
    •	fRead()
    •	fSeek()
    •	dRead() i.e. DiskRead
    •	fCD()
    •	fMkdir()
    •	Flags for O_RDWR or O_CREAT for accessing different files


    Note:
    A brief Introduction to the File Manager can be seen in attached Images.
